title: Upgrade from v1.0 to v1.1
order: 2

### Breaking Changes

- Version 1.1 standardizes plugins and now requires that all plugins must be implemented using class. Then the plugin methods can be called via `lf.extension.[plugin name].[plugin method]`. The original `lf.[plugin method]` is still available and will be deprecated in subsequent versions.
- Updates to the api of `MiniMap` are not compatible with older versions. `MiniMap.show()` -> `lf.extension.miniMap.show()`; `MiniMap.hide()` -> `lf.extension.miniMap.hide()`
